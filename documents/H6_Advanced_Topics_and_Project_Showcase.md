## Using an IR Remote Control
In this section, you will learn how to use an IR remote control to send commands to your Arduino. This involves reading the IR signal and using it to perform actions based on the received commands.

### Components Needed:
- 1 x IR remote control
- 1 x IR receiver module
- Jumper wires

### Circuit Setup:
1. Connect the IR receiver module:
   - VCC to 5V
   - GND to GND
   - Signal pin to digital pin (e.g., pin 2)

### Code Example:
1. Install the IRremote library.
2. Use the following code to read the IR signal and display the received commands in the Serial Monitor:

```c
#include <IRremote.h>

#define PIN_RECEIVER 2   // Signal Pin of IR receiver

IRrecv receiver(PIN_RECEIVER);

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  receiver.enableIRIn(); // Start the receiver
}

void loop()
{
  // Checks if an IR signal is received
  if (receiver.decode()) {
    translateIR();
    receiver.resume();  // Receive the next value
  }
}

void translateIR()
{
  // Takes action based on the received IR code
  Serial.println(receiver.decodedIRData.command);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **IRremote.h:** Include the IR remote library.
- **IRrecv receiver(PIN_RECEIVER);**: Initialize the IR receiver on the specified pin.
- **receiver.enableIRIn();**: Start the IR receiver.
- **receiver.decode();**: Check if an IR signal is received.
- **translateIR();**: Function to handle the received IR signal.
- **receiver.resume();**: Prepare to receive the next IR signal.
- **receiver.decodedIRData.command;**: Get the command from the received IR signal.

## Project Showcase
This is an opportunity for participants to present their projects and demonstrate what they have learned. Each participant will explain their project, the components used, and the code they wrote.

### Tips for Project Showcase:
1. **Prepare your Presentation:**
   - Briefly describe your project idea.
   - Explain the components used and their connections.
   - Walk through the code and highlight key parts.
   - Demonstrate the working project.

2. **Practice:**
   - Ensure your project works as expected.
   - Practice explaining your project clearly and concisely.

3. **Engage the Audience:**
   - Encourage questions and feedback.
   - Be prepared to troubleshoot any issues that arise during the demonstration.

### Example Projects:
- **Automated Plant Watering System:** Using a soil moisture sensor to control a water pump.
- **Smart Home Lighting:** Using motion sensors and relays to control home lighting.
- **Weather Station:** Displaying temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure data on an LCD.
