## Controlling a Stepper Motor using an IR Remote Control
In this section, you will learn how to control a stepper motor using an IR remote control. This involves reading the IR signal and using it to drive the stepper motor.

### Components Needed:
- 1 x Stepper motor and driver
- 1 x IR remote control
- 1 x IR receiver module
- Jumper wires

### Circuit Setup:
1. Connect the stepper motor to the driver module.
2. Connect the driver module to the Arduino:
   - Step pin to digital pin (e.g., pin 3)
   - Direction pin to digital pin (e.g., pin 4)
   - Enable pin to digital pin (e.g., pin 5)
   - VCC to 5V
   - GND to GND
3. Connect the IR receiver module:
   - VCC to 5V
   - GND to GND
   - Signal pin to digital pin (e.g., pin 2)

### Code Example:
1. Install the IRremote library.
2. Use the following code to read the IR signal and control the stepper motor:

```c
#include <IRremote.h>
#include <AccelStepper.h>

const int RECV_PIN = 2;
IRrecv irrecv(RECV_PIN);
decode_results results;

AccelStepper stepper(1, 3, 4); // 1 = Driver, 3 = Step pin, 4 = Direction pin

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  irrecv.enableIRIn(); // Start the receiver
  stepper.setMaxSpeed(1000);
  stepper.setAcceleration(500);
}

void loop() {
  if (irrecv.decode(&results)) {
    Serial.println(results.value, HEX);
    if (results.value == 0xFFA25D) { // Replace with your IR remote code
      stepper.moveTo(stepper.currentPosition() + 200);
    }
    if (results.value == 0xFF629D) { // Replace with your IR remote code
      stepper.moveTo(stepper.currentPosition() - 200);
    }
    irrecv.resume(); // Receive the next value
  }
  stepper.run();
}
```

### Explanation:
- **IRremote.h:** Include the IR remote library.
- **AccelStepper.h:** Include the stepper motor library.
- **IRrecv irrecv(RECV_PIN);**: Initialize the IR receiver.
- **AccelStepper stepper(1, 3, 4);**: Initialize the stepper motor (driver type, step pin, direction pin).
- **irrecv.enableIRIn();**: Start the IR receiver.
- **stepper.setMaxSpeed(1000);**: Set the maximum speed for the stepper motor.
- **stepper.setAcceleration(500);**: Set the acceleration for the stepper motor.
- **irrecv.decode(&results);**: Decode the incoming IR signal.
- **stepper.moveTo(stepper.currentPosition() + 200);**: Move the stepper motor forward.
- **stepper.moveTo(stepper.currentPosition() - 200);**: Move the stepper motor backward.

## Project Showcase
This is an opportunity for participants to present their projects and demonstrate what they have learned. Each participant will explain their project, the components used, and the code they wrote.

### Tips for Project Showcase:
1. **Prepare your Presentation:**
   - Briefly describe your project idea.
   - Explain the components used and their connections.
   - Walk through the code and highlight key parts.
   - Demonstrate the working project.

2. **Practice:**
   - Ensure your project works as expected.
   - Practice explaining your project clearly and concisely.

3. **Engage the Audience:**
   - Encourage questions and feedback.
   - Be prepared to troubleshoot any issues that arise during the demonstration.

### Example Projects:
- **Automated Plant Watering System:** Using a soil moisture sensor to control a water pump.
- **Smart Home Lighting:** Using motion sensors and relays to control home lighting.
- **Weather Station:** Displaying temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure data on an LCD.
